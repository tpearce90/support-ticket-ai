# 🧠 AI-Powered Support Ticket Triage (Python + ML Project)

This project simulates a real-world AI workflow for a support team by combining rule-based logic, machine learning, and data visualization in Python. Built entirely in Google Colab and shared as a complete, reproducible project.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This support ticket triage system:
- Automatically categorizes support tickets using both rule-based logic and machine learning
- Scores urgency with custom priority detection
- Generates AI-style auto-replies based on predicted issue type
- Visualizes support trends over time
- Trains and evaluates a real ML model on ticket text

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- pandas
- scikit-learn (Multinomial Naive Bayes)
- matplotlib
- TfidfVectorizer (for NLP)
- Google Colab
